When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Not really sure, it doesn't really seem like it matters as long as eventually you push your work to github. But if you are working real time with someone else and want it to be faster, then it may be a benefit to make changes directly into github.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because if it happened automatically, it could happen while you are in the middle of experimenting with some piece of code, and you wouldn't want to commit at that time.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
If i saw a project on github that i wanted to expand upon, i would fork it. If i wanted to get a repository that is on github to be on my local machine, i would clone it. And if i wanted to to add a feature to that project and not change the master, i would create a branch.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
So that you can update it with the lastest commit from the remote, without having to combine commits immediately.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
it seems like this is an excellent solution over the rest like SVN etc.
