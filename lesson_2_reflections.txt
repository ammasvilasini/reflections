What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It creates a git repository on your local system. You can use this to have version control on a local file system.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is in between the working directory and repository, so before you know if you want to commit - then you can experiment in the staging area and commit after you know that is what you want to do.
